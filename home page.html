               I really love playing chess since when i am in my 6th grade when I started learning chess, chess is  more than just a game, chess taught me how to be patience and specially how to to think critically in making decisions. 
               
               when i learned how to play chess, i was able to compete from the municipal meet and luckily I won against the 6th other players and after i won i join the provincial meet chess tournament which I ended up 3rd place not bad as a beginner. 
               
               playing chess is my way of expressing my self, my comfort zone, and it help me reducing my academic stress. 
               
               Aside of playing chess, i also love listening to music because music can make me relaxx, and somtimes i also love watching anime, especially ONE PIECE because i was attached by the story because one piece is all about  friendship.
